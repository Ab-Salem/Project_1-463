# Project_1-463

This Program analyzes a large financial dataset (CSV file) to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies. The program uses divide-and-conquer techniques to efficiently process, analyze, and report on financial data for decision-making purposes.

# How To Use:

1. Install the Required Library through the terminal: 'pip install matplotlib'
2. Ensure the CSV is in the main directory of the Program (IF USING DIFFERENT CSV FILE FOR FINANCIAL DATA, PLEASE ENSURE COLUMN NAMES ARE: Date,Last,Volume,Open,High,Low)
3. run SalemFinance.py
4. OUTPUT: Report.txt and 'stock_price_trend.png' will be generated
   
#

Tip: The stock_price_trend.png and REPORT.txt will be overridden everytime you run the program if you have them in the main directory. Save to another directory or change file name to not lose results.
