# Project_1-463

This Program analyzes a large financial dataset (CSV file) to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies. The program uses divide-and-conquer techniques to efficiently process, analyze, and report on financial data for decision-making purposes.

# How To Use:

1. Install the Required Library through the terminal: 'pip install matplotlib'
2. Ensure the CSV is in the main directory of the Program (IF USING DIFFERENT CSV FILE FOR FINANCIAL DATA, PLEASE ENSURE COLUMN NAMES ARE: Date,Last,Volume,Open,High,Low)
3. run main2.py
4. OUTPUT: Report and 'stock_price_trend.png' will be generated
